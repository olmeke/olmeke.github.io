I am a PhD student at [Univeristy of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) in the [Computer Security Lab](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/) advised by [Giovannia Vigna](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/) and [Christopher Kruegel](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~chris/).
I am interested in systems security, binary analysis, root causing, ML applications in security.
Previously, I worked on ARM TrustZone security, rehosting, and OS security.
If you are interested, send me an email, I am happy to talk!

Before starting the PhD, I did a Bachelor's at [FAU](https://www.fau.eu/).
I wrote my thesis on rehosting bootloaders of COTS mobile devices.

## Projects

Speech Style Transfer <small>Fall 2022</small>
* Developed one-click pipeline for speech style transfer based on SOTA models AutoPST, AutoVC
* Evaluated the model performance on a multi-accent name dataset, live data during a demo presentation

Fake News Detection <small>Spring 2022</small>
* Developed an end-to-end data collection pipeline using the Twitter API v1 and v2 that generates a dataset for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models starting from a set of root tweets
* Evaluated the performance of existing GNN models (developed in PyTorch) on multiple social media datasets
